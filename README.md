*Docker Community Edition* (CE) is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps. 

Docker CE has two update channels, stable, edge and nightly:

* Stable gives you reliable updates every quarter
* Edge gives you new features every month
* Nightly gives you nightly updates every day

For more information about Docker CE, see [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition/).
