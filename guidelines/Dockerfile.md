# Best practices for writing Dockerfiles

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile, a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. Dockerfiles adhere to a specific format and use a specific set of instructions. You can learn the basics on the Dockerfile Reference page. If you’re new to writing Dockerfiles, you should start there.

This document covers the best practices and methods recommended by Docker, Inc. and the Docker community for creating easy-to-use, effective Dockerfiles. We strongly suggest you follow these recommendations (in fact, if you’re creating an Official Image, you must adhere to these practices).
